# R

This folder should contain any custom R functions used throughout the project.

Additionally, it may contain various R scripts necessary for cleaning the data, summarizing information, fitting models, creating figures, etc. These scripts should be organized in a logical progression and given names that indicate their order and a description of what they do. For example,

`01_data-cleaning.R`

`02_data-summaries.R`

`03_model-fitting.R`

`04_plots.R`
